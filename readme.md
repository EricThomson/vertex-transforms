## vertex-transformations

Using Python to build intuitions about one fragment of the OpenGL rendering pipeline. We go over the basic vertex transformations: the model, view, and projection matrices.

If the `ipynb` file doesn't render in your browser, [try viewing it in Jupyter nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/EricThomson/vertex-transforms/blob/master/vertex_transforms.ipynb).

Comments/suggestions welcome. This is aimed at people who know some linear algebra and Python, but are new to 3D Graphics/OpenGL. For more OpenGL from a Python perspective, I recommend the online manuscript [Python and OpenGL for Scientific Visualization](http://www.labri.fr/perso/nrougier/python-opengl/#python-opengl-for-scientific-visualization) by Nicolas Rougier.
